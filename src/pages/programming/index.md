excerpt: "So I have taken on the challenge of learning vim. I have worked
with fellow devs who spoke highly of it and exclaimed how great it was to work in,
and I wanted to give it a shot for myself."

I Started by asking a friend if they would be willing to share their configuration
folders, but after receiving them, I quickly realized my mistake. I had thought
configuring your own personal environment for vim would be simple, but quickly caught on
that it can become quite involved rather quickly. Suffice to say, I understood
very little of what my friends config file was doing by just reading it cold, and quickly decided to go a more bare bones route. I figured, if I am going to need to learn
how to set it up, might as well start with the basics!
